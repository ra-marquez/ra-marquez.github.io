> "Nothing in science has any value to society if it is not communicated"
> â€” Anne Roe

I have always loved science communication! I firmly believe that communicating science is crucial for helping the community understand the importance of science in our daily lives and inspiring the next generation of scientists. 

YouTube Channels like [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA) and [Vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/@Vsauce) have greatly inspired me. I have started my own science communication project, [Catalastic](https://www.youtube.com/@Catalastic), which aims to "Speed up science communication." Check out these two poster pitch videos I created and posted on Catalastic!

I plan to grow this initiative throughout my career in collaboration with my future students and other content creators to ensure my research is understood by everyone!
