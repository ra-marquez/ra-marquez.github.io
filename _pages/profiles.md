> "Nothing in science has any value to society if it is not communicated."
> — Anne Roe

I have always loved science communication! I firmly believe that communicating science is crucial for helping the community understand the importance of science in our daily lives and inspiring the next generation of scientists. 

YouTube Channels like [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA) and [Vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/@Vsauce) have greatly inspired me. I have started my own science communication project, [Catalastic](https://www.youtube.com/@Catalastic), which aims to "Speed up science communication." Check out these two poster pitch videos I created and posted on Catalastic!

I am committed to expanding this initiative throughout my career, collaborating with my future students and other content creators to communicate science effectively to the community!

In line with my passion for science communication, I have actively shared my enthusiasm for education with a diverse audience, ranging from elementary students to undergraduates. I have been fortunate to serve as co-instructor for [Clubes de Ciencia Mexico (CdeCMx)](https://clubesdeciencia.mx/en/), a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing scientific education through exceptional extracurricular STEM programs. 

Annually, CdeCMx offers free, high-quality workshops and courses across various STEM fields in Mexico, crafted by young scientists and innovators from top institutions in Mexico and the U.S. My contributions have included developing and leading two workshops focused on electrochemistry and materials science. The pedagogical effectiveness of these workshops is currently being evaluated for publication in the Journal of Chemical Education of the ACS.

I currently serve as an international ambassador of CdeCMx, and I am committed to continuing my support for this initiative. I aim to inspire and educate the next generation of scientists and professionals in developing countries!

During my Ph.D. at UT-Austin, I also served as Secretary of the UT-Austin ECS Student Chapter. In this role, I organized various educational and social events, collaborating with an amazing team of graduate students. A key initiative we led was a series of chalk talks on electrochemistry, designed primarily for graduate students and postdocs to foster both academic and interpersonal skills within the field. I managed the recording, editing, and distribution of these talks on our [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd9wYxbD3iPSXoyulwnUukQ). To learn more about the activities we organized, visit our  [official website](https://sites.utexas.edu/ecs/).
