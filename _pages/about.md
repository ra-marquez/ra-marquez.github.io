Welcome! Raul here. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. 
I earned my PhD in Chemistry from The University of Texas at Austin, and my BE in Chemical Engineering and MS in Chemistry, both Cum Laude, from Universidad Autonoma de Chihuahua, Mexico.  

With nine years of research in <strong>electrocatalysis</strong>, <strong>analytical chemistry</strong>, and <strong>electrochemical engineering</strong>, my experience spans <strong>device prototyping</strong>, <strong>characterization techniques</strong>, and <strong>electrochemistry</strong>. My academic journey is supported by a <strong>strong publication record</strong> and successful project <strong>leadership</strong>. Furthermore, I actively develop new <strong>science communication</strong> and <strong>education</strong> strategies. I aim to lead a research group dedicated to studying <strong>electrochemical interfaces</strong> to develop next-generation energy conversion technologies and electrochemical separations.

Please feel free to reach out. I'm always open to collaborations and eager to assist others!
