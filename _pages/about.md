Welcome! Raul here. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. 

I earned my PhD in Chemistry at The University of Texas at Austin, and my BE in Chemical Engineering and MS in Chemistry at Universidad Autonoma de Chihuahua, Mexico. I have 10+ years of experience in electrochemistry, analytical chemistry, materials science, and electrochemical engineering. 

My research focuses on studying <strong>electrochemical interfaces</strong> in <strong>catalysis</strong>, <strong>corrosion science</strong>, <strong>electrochemical energy conversion</strong>, and <strong>electrochemically-mediated separations</strong>. I leverage my background in analytical chemistry to develop advanced characterization techniques and maintain rigor in science. 

Feel free to reach out. I am always open to collaborations and eager to assist others!
