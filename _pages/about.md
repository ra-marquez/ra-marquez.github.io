Welcome! Iâ€™m Raul, a PhD candidate in Chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin. I earned my BE in Chemical Engineering and MS in Chemistry, both Cum Laude, from Universidad Autonoma de Chihuahua, Mexico.  

With over eight years of research in <strong>electrocatalysis</strong>, <strong>analytical chemistry</strong>, and <strong>electrochemical engineering</strong>, I have extensive experience in <strong>device prototyping</strong>, <strong>characterization techniques</strong>, and <strong>electrochemistry</strong>. My academic journey is supported by a <strong>strong publication record</strong> and successful project <strong>leadership</strong>. I'm also passionate about <strong>science communication</strong> and <strong>education</strong>. I'm committed to leading a research group dedicated to advancing <strong>sustainability</strong> in chemistry and engineering.

Please feel free to reach out. I'm always open to collaborations and eager to assist others!
