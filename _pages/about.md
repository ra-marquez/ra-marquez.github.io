Welcome! Iâ€™m Raul, a PhD candidate in Chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin. I earned my BE in Chemical Engineering and MS in Chemistry, both Cum Laude, from Universidad Autonoma de Chihuahua, Mexico.  

With over eight years of research in electrocatalysis, analytical chemistry, and electrochemical engineering, I have extensive experience in device prototyping, analytical methods, and electrochemistry. My academic journey is supported by a strong publication record and successful project leadership. I'm also passionate about science communication and education. I'm committed to leading a research group dedicated to advancing sustainability in chemistry and engineering.

Please feel free to reach out. I'm always open to collaborations and eager to assist others!
