> "It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge."
> â€” Albert Einstein

Sharing knowledge has always been a profound passion of mine, but my approach extends beyond traditional teaching. I am driven by a desire to motivate and inspire others, nurturing their potential so they can make great achievements!  

Since high school, I have embraced roles as a teaching assistant and course instructor, leading lectures, laboratory sessions, and office hours across both in-person and virtual platforms, including during the challenging periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

At UT-Austin, I completed the semester-long pedagogy course GRS 097: Fundamentals for Teaching Assistants to refine my teaching strategies and incorporate active learning activities effectively. 

Over the years, I've taught a diverse array of subjects, from general chemistry at UT Austin to electrochemistry at ITESM and physical chemistry and materials science at UACH. My experience also includes assisting in courses in analytical chemistry, chemical reaction engineering, transport phenomena, and instrumental analysis. 

Beyond the academic realm, I've imparted skills in first aid, CPR, humanitarian aid, and rope rescue as a Red Cross volunteer. This wide variety of areas denotes my interest in and value of cross-disciplinary knowledge in science and engineering.

My teaching methodologies adhere to the [Standards and Guidelines for Chemistry Education established by the ACS]( https://www.acs.org/education/policies.html). I also incorporate resources from the [AIChE Institute for Learning and Innovation]( https://www.aiche.org/ili/educators) to enhance STEM education. I stay informed with the latest educational strategies through journals like the [Journal of Chemical Education](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jceda8). 

Furthermore, I've also co-designed and co-instructed intensive courses on electrochemical energy devices for [Clubes de Ciencia MX](https://clubesdeciencia.mx/en/). The course materials, laboratory handouts, and student assessment tools are described in a [refereed article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.4c00445) published in the Journal of Chemical Education. Feel free to email me if you want access to all the materials!

I strongly believe in the importance of active learning, and thus I always integrate visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements into my teaching. I am passionate about new technologies, so I frequently employ digital tools to create engaging educational content, such as infographics, videos, and animations, aiming to reach not just students but also the general public. For example, these are some graphics I've created to explain concepts in electrochemistry!

I have developed strong oral communication skills fueled by a deep passion for public speaking. I enjoy delivering interactive talks and have extensive experience creating engaging slideshows, videos, tutorials, and recording classes.
