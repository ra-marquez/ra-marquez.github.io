> "It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge"
> â€” Albert Einstein

Sharing knowledge with others has always been one of my biggest passions. However, I believe my work goes beyond being merely a teacher because I like motivating and inspiring rather than just sharing knowledge. I'm passionate about becoming a mentor, and I like to think that I am planting seeds that will eventually grow intellects larger than mine. 

I have worked as a teaching assistant and course instructor since high school. I have led lectures, laboratory sessions, and office hours, both in-person and online, including two semesters during the COVID-19 pandemic. At UT-Austin, I completed a semester-long pedagogy course (GRS 097: Fundamentals for Teaching Assistants) for graduate teaching assistants to learn strategies, including leading effective discussion sections, lesson-making strategies, and the use of active learning activities.

I have taught several courses, including general chemistry (UT Austin), electrochemistry (ITESM), physical chemistry (UACH), and materials science topics (ITESM). I have also assisted other teachers and mentors at UACH with analytical chemistry, quantum chemistry, and instrumental analysis. Outside academia, I have trained people in first aid, CPR, humanitarian aid, and rope rescue as a Red Cross volunteer during high school. After being involved in various topics, I have realized the importance of creating cross-disciplinary knowledge and skills in science and engineering. 

I've co-designed and co-instructed two one-week intensive courses for high school and undergraduate students on electrochemical energy devices and electrochemistry as part of [Clubes de Ciencia MX](https://clubesdeciencia.mx/en/). We published the detailed course plan, handouts, and course evaluation in a publication submitted to the Journal of Chemical Education of the American Chemical Society. You can find the publication here.

I strongly believe in the importance of active learning, and thus I always include visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning approaches. I am passionate about digital tools and social media, so I love making infographics, editing videos, and creating animations to explain complex concepts, especially to broader audiences. These are some graphics I've created to explain concepts in electrochemistry!

I have always loved science communication. I firmly believe that communicating science is essential so that the community can understand the relevance of science in our lives, and inspire young minds (like me, when I was a teenager) to advance science.  In fact, YouTube Channels like [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA) and [Vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/@Vsauce) have been my greatest inspirations. I have my own science communication project, [Catalastic](https://www.youtube.com/@Catalastic), still a newborn, that aims to "Speed up science communication." I aim to develop this  effort during my career in collaboration with my future students. Check out these two poster pitch videos I created and posted in Catalastic!
