<p class="font-weight-bold">Motivation</p>

Air quality is a critical environmental issue, with hydrogen sulfide being one of the most dangerous air pollutants. Hydrogen sulfide is highly toxic, capable of rapid absorption through inhalation, and causing severe health issues affecting the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. Therefore, the effective capture of this pollutant is essential for many industrial processes before its release into the atmosphere. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), known for their chemical stability, have shown great promise in efficiently capturing hydrogen sulfide. Previous research has found that hydrogen sulfide converts into polysulfide species spontaneously inside the micropores of MOFs at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This transformation presents a significant opportunity for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries requiring exceptional sulfur host cathode materials. MOFs confine polysulfides through physical encapsulation and chemical adsorption, addressing the common issue in Li-S batteries where the diffusion of soluble polysulfide intermediates leads to the irreversible loss of active materials.

In collaboration with researchers at UNAM in Mexico, I am exploring the use of MOFs as cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries. The choice of SU-101 is driven by [its potential to control polysulfide formation](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c07525), thereby enhancing battery stability and extending its lifetime.
