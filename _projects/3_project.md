<p class="font-weight-bold">Motivation</p>

Among various hydrogen production methods, thermochemical water-splitting cycles (TCWSCs) provide a promising approach for large-scale hydrogen generation. These cycles split water into hydrogen and oxygen using nuclear or solar energy (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).

Sulfur-based TCWSCs provide an additional advantage, using sulfur dioxide (SO2) from flue gas emissions as feedstock. A critical step in sulfur-based TCWSCs is oxidizing S(IV) species. This reaction can be done electrochemically under ambient conditions by replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolyzers. Despite its potential, this proof-of-concept reaction lacks the critical data for developing new catalysts and understanding reaction dynamics, including catalyst poisoning and corrosion. 

> My research aims to develop <strong>new catalytic reactions</strong> for converting sulfur species into useful products, focusing on large-scale, industrial applications like TCWSCs.
> I am particularly interested in revealing how <strong>multi-valent sulfur species</strong> interact with noble and earth-abundant electrocatalysts

During my undergraduate research at UACH, our group synthesized and characterized Pd catalysts for sulfite electrooxidation. Initially, [we assessed a proof-of-concept](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.08.213) electrochemical membrane reactor's performance for sulfite ion electrooxidation at near-neutral pH. After confirming the reaction's feasibility, [we investigated](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elecom.2019.106481) the kinetics of sulfite ion electrooxidation on Pd electrocatalysts using a rotating disk electrode under various conditions (<strong>Figure 2</strong>).

We subsequently scaled the reaction to an electrolyzer level and analyzed the impact of operational conditions in another [study](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c04190). For more details on this project, please see the Sustainable Processes category on the research page.

Looking ahead, I plan to continue my research on sulfur oxidation processes, focusing on catalysis design and characterization.
