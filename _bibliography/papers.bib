  title={Transition metal incorporation: electrochemical, structure, and chemical effects on nickel oxyhydroxide oxygen-evolution electrocatalysts},

  abstract={Understanding how electrode materials evolve in energy conversion and storage devices is critical to optimizing their performance. We report a comprehensive investigation into the impact of in situ metal incorporation on nickel oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, encompassing four multivalent cations: Fe, Co, Mn, and Cu. We found that adding trace amounts of these cations to alkaline electrolytes alters the electrocatalytic and energy storage properties of NiOxHy films after electrochemical conditioning. As opposed to the well-known increase in OER activity induced by Fe, in situ incorporation of trace Co and Mn cations increases the total capacitance, while Cu incorporation does not proceed. We show that increasing Fe and Co concentrations leads to a maximum electrochemical performance attributed to a saturation threshold in the metal uptake. Depth profiling measurements reveal that metal incorporation is confined to the surface of the film, resulting in an interstratified structure that partially retains the more active, disordered phase at the surface. Building upon solid-state chemistry principles, we provide an in-depth discussion of four critical factors determining the occurrence of in situ metal incorporation, underscoring its nature as a cation exchange process. To further support this concept, we manipulate cation exchange by shifting the solubility equilibrium and via ion complexation. By providing a better understanding of in situ metal incorporation, our results underscore its potential as a strategy for manipulating the surface chemical composition, thus advancing the development of electrochemical energy materials.},

  abstract={Boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in alkaline media has been a topic of interest in a world that continuously strives for cleaner energy conversion systems. The paucity of protons provides a challenge to performing the HER in an alkaline environment and is a major impediment to decreasing the energy requirement needed to produce hydrogen. Here, we improve the HER activity of nickel-nitride by electrochemically anodizing the surface which aids water dissociation in alkaline HER. We experimentally show that by oxidizing the nickel nitride on a nickel foam (Ni3N/NF) surface using cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles in Fe-unpurified KOH media, Ni3N can be converted to a Ni(OH)2/Ni3N composite. Activation of the Ni3N/NF with 50 CV cycles resulted in a low HER overpotential of 172 and 207 mV at the current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. The 50 CV cycle Ni3N/NF also had the minimum charge transfer resistance at 6 Ω compared to all other prepared samples, and the Tafel slope is 100.87 mV dec−1.},

  abstract={Transition metal borides, carbides, pnictides, and chalcogenides (X-ides) have emerged as a class of materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Because of their high earth abundance, electrical conductivity, and OER performance, these electrocatalysts have the potential to enable the practical application of green energy conversion and storage. Under OER potentials, X-ide electrocatalysts demonstrate various degrees of oxidation resistance due to their differences in chemical composition, crystal structure, and morphology. Depending on their resistance to oxidation, these catalysts will fall into one of three post-OER electrocatalyst categories: fully oxidized oxide/(oxy)hydroxide material, partially oxidized core@shell structure, and unoxidized material. In the past ten years (from 2013 to 2022), over 890 peer-reviewed research papers have focused on X-ide OER electrocatalysts. Previous review papers have provided limited conclusions and have omitted the significance of “catalytically active sites/species/phases” in X-ide OER electrocatalysts. In this review, a comprehensive summary of (i) experimental parameters (e.g., substrates, electrocatalyst loading amounts, geometric overpotentials, Tafel slopes, etc.) and (ii) electrochemical stability tests and post-analyses in X-ide OER electrocatalyst publications from 2013 to 2022 is provided. Both mono and polyanion X-ides are discussed and classified with respect to their material transformation during the OER. Special analytical techniques employed to study X-ide reconstruction are also evaluated. Additionally, future challenges and questions yet to be answered are provided in each section. This review aims to provide researchers with a toolkit to approach X-ide OER electrocatalyst research and to showcase necessary avenues for future investigation.},

  abstract={In this Viewpoint, we study the iR compensation for the alkaline OER system as a case study. We aim to identify the experimental pitfalls that can arise when applying iR compensation to the study of catalytic electrodes. First, we discuss several cases in which the same catalytic electrode exhibits different OER activity depending on the methods used for Ru measurement and iR compensation. To understand the underlying causes behind this issue, we investigate the roles of different Ru components in iR compensation depending on the electrode properties and electrochemical testing conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the results obtained from potentiodynamic analysis of the electrode’s redox reaction can vary depending on the method and degree of iR compensation. These variations are attributed to a change in the actual scan rate near the redox peak during potentiodynamic analysis and the occurrence of electron -rapping phenomena within the electrode. Lastly, we provide practical guidelines on how to correctly measure and interpret the Ru value and how to select the proper iR compensation method for studying the redox reaction and electrocatalytic activity of the electrode.},

Moreover, recent discoveries of new types of active site, active species, reaction mechanism, and the driving force of the OER further complicate our understanding of the OER. Herein, a review of the key concepts of the OER at the atomic/molecular scale is given, focusing on providing their clear definitions, principles, categories, and commonalities and differences.

  abstract={Aqueous zinc-ion batteries are regarded as promising candidates for future energy storage devices because of their high safety. Due to the dissolution in the aqueous electrolytes, most vanadate-based zinc-ion batteries suffer from continuous capacity fading. In some cases, a capacity reactivation process can be observed in vanadate-based cathodes after capacity decay. Herein, we employed electrochemical methods and characterization techniques to study the reaction mechanism of capacity reactivation in Ag0.33V2O5 cathodes. Our preliminary results suggested that the reactivation is due to an in situ crystalline structure evolution in the cathode materials. Under the electrochemical condition, a new phase Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O irreversibly formed on the initial cathodes, which prevented the dissolution of vanadate and further resulted in the capacity increase. Moreover, we confirmed the unique intercalation pseudocapacitive behavior in the reconstructed Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O, which provided fast ionic diffusion to facilitate electrochemical performance. Accordingly, our study offers a new understanding of the capacity change of the vanadate-based cathode materials and provides a more general explanation of the capacity reactivation in aqueous zinc-ion batteries.},

  abstract={Alkaline water electrolysis, a promising technology for clean energy storage, is constrained by extrinsic factors in addition to intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. To begin to compare between catalytic materials for electrolysis applications, these extrinsic factors must first be understood and controlled. Here, we modify extrinsic electrode properties and study the effects of bubble release to examine how the electrode and surface design impact the performance of water electrolysis. We fabricate robust and cost-effective electrodes through a sequential three-dimensional (3D) printing and metal deposition procedure. Through a systematic assessment of the deposition procedure, we confirm the close relationship between extrinsic electrode properties (i.e., wettability, surface roughness, and electrochemically active surface area) and electrochemical performance. Modifying the electrode geometry, size, and electrolyte flow rate results in an overpotential decrease and different bubble diameters and lifetimes for the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Hence, we demonstrate the essential role of the electrode architecture and forced electrolyte convection on bubble release. Additionally, we confirm the suitability of ordered, Ni-coated 3D porous structures by evaluating the HER/OER performance, bubble dissipation, and long-term stability. Finally, we utilize the 3D porous electrode as a support for studying a benchmark NiFe electrocatalyst, confirming the robustness and effectiveness of 3D-printed electrodes for testing electrocatalytic materials while extrinsic properties are precisely controlled. Overall, we demonstrate that tailoring electrode architectures and surface properties result in precise tuning of extrinsic electrode properties, providing more reproducible and comparable conditions for testing the efficiency of electrode materials for water electrolysis.},

  abstract={Electrochemical conditioning via chronopotentiometry (CP) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) is essential for the activation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. While many reports have activated OER electrocatalysts using either CP or CV, the inherent differences between these two electrochemical conditioning methods for the activation of OER electrocatalytic materials have yet to be explored. Here, we investigate the effects of CP and CV electrochemical conditioning on a Ni-based OER precatalyst and substrate in Fe-purified and Fe-unpurified KOH electrolytes by employing (i) Ni foil, (ii) NiSe precatalyst films with different thicknesses on the fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate, and (iii) NiSe precatalyst films on Ni foil substrates. It was found that CV electrochemical conditioning can result in a higher degree of in situ oxidation and Fe incorporation for Ni-based precatalysts and substrates compared to CP electrochemical conditioning. In turn, this brought about different material properties (e.g., in situ oxidized layer thickness, composition, crystallinity, and morphology) and electrochemical characteristics (e.g., active surface area, electron transport limitation, and intrinsic activity) of Ni-based electrocatalysts, thereby not only affecting their OER activity but also complicating the interpretation of the origin of OER activity. This study identifies the distinct effects of CP and CV electrochemical conditioning on Ni-based OER electrocatalysts and provides insight into the choice of the electrochemical conditioning method to better investigate OER electrocatalysts.},

  abstract={Nickel nitride (Ni3N) is known as one of the promising precatalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. Due to its relatively low oxidation resistance, Ni3N is electrochemically self-oxidized into nickel oxides/oxyhydroxides (electroactive sites) during the OER. However, we lack a full understanding of the effects of Ni3N self-oxidation and Fe impurity incorporation into Ni3N from electrolyte towards OER activity. Here, we report on our examination of the compositional and structural transformation of Ni3N precatalyst layers on Ni foams (Ni3N/Ni foam) during extended periods of OER testing in Fe-purified and unpurified KOH media using both a standard three-electrode cell and a flow cell, and discuss their electrocatalytic properties. After the OER tests in both KOH media, the Ni3N surfaces were converted into amorphous, nano-porous nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide surfaces. In the Fe-purified electrolyte, a decrease in OER activity was confirmed after the OER test because of the formation of pure NiOOH with low OER activity and electrical conductivity. Conversely, in the unpurified electrolyte, a continuous increase in OER activity was observed over the OER testing, which may have resulted from the Fe incorporation into the self-oxidation-formed NiOOH. Our experimental findings revealed that Fe impurities play an essential role in obtaining notable OER activity using the Ni3N precatalyst. Additionally, our Ni3N/Ni foam electrode exhibited a low OER overpotential of 262 mV to reach a geometric current density of 10 mA cmgeo−2 in a flow cell with unpurified electrolyte.},

  abstract={Electrochemical water splitting is one of the most promising approaches for sustainable energy conversion and storage toward a future hydrogen society. This demands durable and affordable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we report the preparation of uniform Ni–P–O, Ni–S–O, and Ni–S–P–O electrocatalytic films on nickel foam (NF) substrates via flow cell-assisted electrodeposition. Remarkably, electrodeposition onto 12 cm2 substrates was optimized by strategically varying critical parameters. The high quality and reproducibility of the materials is attributed to the use of a 3D-printed flow cell with a tailored design. Then, the as-fabricated electrodes were tested for overall water splitting in the same flow cell under alkaline conditions. The best-performing sample, NiSP/NF, required relatively low overpotentials of 93 mV for the HER and 259 mV for the OER to produce a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Importantly, the electrodeposited films underwent oxidation into amorphous nickel (oxy)hydroxides and oxidized S and P species, improving both HER and OER performance. The superior electrocatalytic performance of the Ni–S–P–O films originates from the unique reconstruction process during the HER/OER. Furthermore, the overall water splitting test using the NiSP/NF couple required a low cell voltage of only 1.85 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm−2. Overall, we demonstrate that high-quality electrocatalysts can be obtained using a simple and reproducible electrodeposition method in a robust 3D-printed flow cell.},

  abstract={The electrochemical oxidation of sulfite ions offers encouraging advantages for large-scale hydrogen production, while sulfur dioxide emissions can be effectively used to obtain value-added byproducts. Herein, the performance and stability during sulfite electrolysis under alkaline conditions are evaluated. Nickel foam (NF) substrates were functionalized as the anode and cathode through electrochemical deposition of palladium and chemical oxidation to carry out the sulfite electro-oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. A combined analytical approach in which a robust electrochemical flow cell was coupled to different in situ and ex situ measurements was successfully implemented to monitor the activity and stability during electrolysis. Overall, satisfactory sulfite conversion and hydrogen production efficiencies (>90%) at 10 mA·cm–2 were mainly attributed to the use of NF in three-dimensional electrodes with a large surface area and enhanced mass transfer. Furthermore, stabilization processes associated with electrochemical dissolution and sulfur crossover through the membrane induced specific changes in the chemical and physical properties of the electrodes after electrolysis. This study demonstrates that NF-based electrocatalysts can be incorporated in an efficient electrochemical flow cell system for sulfite electrolysis and hydrogen production, with potential applications at a large scale.},

  author={Kawashima, K. and Cao, C.L. and Li, H. and Marquez-Montes, R.A. and Wygant, B.R. and Son, Y.J. and Mullins, C.B.},
  abstract={Metallic vanadium carbide (V8C7) with cubic symmetry is examined as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) precatalyst in alkaline media. Herein, we used quasi in situ scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry to investigate the structural transformation of the precatalyst V8C7 microparticles during extended cyclic voltammetric (CV) OER testing. Interestingly, an anisotropic morphological transformation (from a distorted sphere to a cuboid) of V8C7 was observed. Our theoretical and experimental results strongly suggest that this morphological change happens due to the selective self-oxidation and dissolution of the V8C7(110) and (111) surfaces and the subsequent exposure of the relatively stable (100), (010), and (001) surfaces. These results also suggest that these stable facets are preferable for the OER, and a current density of 10 mA·cm–2 was delivered at an overpotential of 503 mV after the extended CV OER testing.},

  abstract={Coal consumption has led to a worrying surge in flue gas emissions, aggravating health and environmental issues worldwide. Therefore, novel approaches supported by sustainable technologies are needed to exploit flue gas emissions effectively. Here, we evaluate an ammonia-based flue gas desulfurization process based on the photochemical capture of CO2 and SO2 for producing hydrogen and ammonium-based fertilizers. The kinetics and mechanistic pathways for sulfite photooxidation are examined, while process feasibility and environmental relevance are evaluated by process simulation and life cycle assessment. Results show that increasing the initial sulfite concentration results in faster reaction rates, following first-order kinetics with an activation energy of 32.9 kJ/mol. Moreover, kinetics is ascribed to two competing photoinduced radical-mediated reaction pathways. Finally, powering the process by renewable energy leads to positive human health, ecosystems, and resources scores in life cycle assessment, supporting the sustainability of the process. Overall, this approach offers essential insights for large-scale hydrogen production through the photooxidation of captured flue gas emissions.},

  abstract={The study evaluated the spatial and seasonal variations of microplastic abundances in water, sediments, and commercial fishes of a semi-urban tourist impacted estuary in the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico. The prevalence of microplastics (MPs) elucidated diffuse sources namely long-range transport, domestic, agricultural, fishing, industrial and recreational activities and the local climatic conditions. Seasonally, the mean abundances of MPs in both water and sediments were high during Nortes (strong winds) followed by the dry and rainy seasons. Overall, black and blue colored MPs dominated the region and all the recovered plastics were fibers. The commercial fishes (n = 187) contained 881 MPs in their gastrointestinal tracts, suggesting that the food web of the estuary is highly prone to microplastic contamination. SEM images of extracted plastic fibers presented surface morphologies that are impacted by physical strains. Further, the elemental characterization of fibers using EDX displayed significant peaks of Al, As, Cl, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn that were used as additives during the production of plastics. The main types of polymers included low-density polyethylene, polyester, polypropylene, polycarbonate, rayon, polyvinyl chloride, polyacrylonitrile, polyamide, nylon and polyethylene terephthalate. MP abundances demonstrated in this study elucidate that estuaries are a major conduit for land-derived plastics to the ocean and the results will aid in implementing remedial/clean up actions of the estuary for better conservation of the ecosystem.},

  abstract={Sulfur-based thermochemical cycles, such as the hybrid sulfur-ammonia (HySA) cycle, offer a valuable approach in which hydrogen is produced by exploiting sulfur dioxide (potentially pollutant emissions) through the electrochemical oxidation of aqueous sulfite. In this study, the effect of pH on electrooxidation rate was assessed by comparing different reaction scenarios. Then, a Central Composite Design (CCD) combined with a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to optimize batch electrooxidation of ammonium sulfite at near-neutral pH. Results show that the use of an anion exchange membrane (AEM) greatly improves sulfite electrooxidation rate while pH is effectively stabilized. Furthermore, a second-order model that relates applied potential and sulfite concentration with the normalized half-life of the reaction was obtained and verified experimentally at long-term batch electrooxidations. A good agreement between the model and experimental tests, adequate hydrogen recoveries and low sulfur crossover through the membrane demonstrate practical robustness of this approach.},

  abstract={Flow devices fabricated by means of 3D-printing offer an economic and effective approach for testing different electrochemical systems at the laboratory scale. Here, the fabrication and optimization of a novel filter-press electrochemical reactor is described. 3D-printing is used to obtain critical components of the device as a sustainable and efficient manufacturing approach. Hydrodynamics and mass transfer of different flow distributors, turbulence promoters, and nickel foam, as a three-dimensional (3D) electrode, were evaluated by a convenient set of well-known techniques for filter-press reactor characterization. Furthermore, the chemical stability of 3D-printed materials was assessed in several electrolytes used for common electrochemical applications. Designed configurations and geometries exhibited enhanced turbulence and large mass transfer coefficients, which make them adequate for processes such as electrosynthesis, electrodeposition, and electrochemical water splitting. Ultimately, superior performance was validated for nickel foam, demonstrating robustness of the reactor for realistic evaluation of electrocatalytic materials. Therefore, the proposed electrochemical reactor provides a low-cost and versatile alternative for testing electrochemical systems in a wide range of applications.},

  abstract={Electrochemical oxidation of sulfite ions offers an efficient and profitable approach to the conversion of sulfur dioxide, a harmful air pollutant, into valuable by-products via flue gas desulfurization. Here, the electrochemical oxidation of sulfite in near-neutral pH electrolytes is studied in order to determine kinetic parameters and a reaction mechanism. Sulfite electrooxidation on palladium is demonstrated at pH 7.5 and 8.5, the latter being comparable to platinum. Anodic charge transfer coefficients and non-linear reaction orders are linked to a mechanism which involves sulfite adsorption at low potentials. This study proves that sulfite electrooxidation on palladium at near-neutral pH is a useful approach for sulfur dioxide exploitation.},

To address these concerns, we herein discuss three points: (i) calculating the potentials of the Hg/HgO electrodes containing NaOH/KOH internal aqueous solution with different molar concentrations (M), (ii) how to calibrate/check the Hg/HgO electrode potentials, and (iii) additional instructions/precautions that should be considered when using Hg/HgO reference electrodes.},
