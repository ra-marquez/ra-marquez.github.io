  title={Transition metal incorporation: electrochemical, structure, and chemical effects on nickel oxyhydroxide oxygen-evolution electrocatalysts},
  author={Marquez, R.A., Kalokowski, E., Espinosa, M., Bender, J.T., Son, Y.J., Kawashima, K., Chukwuneke, C., Smith, L.A., Celio, H., Dolocan, A., Zhan, X.,  Miller, N.R., Milliron, D.J., Resasco, J., Mullins, C.B},
  abstract={Understanding how electrode materials evolve in energy conversion and storage devices is critical to optimizing their performance. We report a comprehensive investigation into the impact of in situ metal incorporation on nickel oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, encompassing four multivalent cations: Fe, Co, Mn, and Cu. We found that adding trace amounts of these cations to alkaline electrolytes alters the electrocatalytic and energy storage properties of NiOxHy films after electrochemical conditioning. As opposed to the well-known increase in OER activity induced by Fe, in situ incorporation of trace Co and Mn cations increases the total capacitance, while Cu incorporation does not proceed. We show that increasing Fe and Co concentrations leads to a maximum electrochemical performance attributed to a saturation threshold in the metal uptake. Depth profiling measurements reveal that metal incorporation is confined to the surface of the film, resulting in an interstratified structure that partially retains the more active, disordered phase at the surface. Building upon solid-state chemistry principles, we provide an in-depth discussion of four critical factors determining the occurrence of in situ metal incorporation, underscoring its nature as a cation exchange process. To further support this concept, we manipulate cation exchange by shifting the solubility equilibrium and via ion complexation. By providing a better understanding of in situ metal incorporation, our results underscore its potential as a strategy for manipulating the surface chemical composition, thus advancing the development of electrochemical energy materials.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
